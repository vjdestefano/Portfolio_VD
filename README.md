# Portfolio_VD
A simple HTML site to show case some of my work with the Rutgers Bootcamp. Mainly to test the CSS animations and Front-End Layout of future projects.

The liri node section has not been updated, it might be deprecated with the introduction of React into the course.

This will be revisted once the course is completed and my final project has been developed.
